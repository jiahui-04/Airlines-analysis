As part of the BC2402 module, my groupmates and I worked on a project that involved managing databases for multiple airlines. The goal was to analyze the data and provide data-driven insights to help airlines enhance their services and improve the effectiveness of their chatbot responses. This project allowed me to apply database management skills, identify trends, and recommend actionable strategies for customer service optimization.
