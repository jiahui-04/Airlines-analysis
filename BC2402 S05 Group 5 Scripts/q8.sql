# the above method may be flawed but I decided that this method may be better than using MATCH() AGAINST()
# MATCH() AGAINST() gives relevance value, which primarily measures how well a review matches the keyword query
# however, it doesnâ€™t directly indicate how significant the issue is as a complaint 
# so I thought that focusing on frequency and average differences in seat comfort ratings may provide more actionable insights 
# into the severity and prevalence of the complaints
