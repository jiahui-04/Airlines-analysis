# Decoding Airline Success  
BC2402 – Design & Development of Databases (Group Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyses airline customer behaviour, preferences, complaints, and performance using relational and non-relational databases. By integrating booking data, airline reviews, customer support logs, and external industry data, we uncover insights into airline success factors, seasonal trends, post-COVID shifts, and customer service design. The project focuses on data-driven decision making** for airlines, with Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways as primary case studies.


## Objectives
- Analyse relationships between flight characteristics and customer preferences
- Identify seasonal and class-based differences in airline ratings
- Discover common customer complaints** by traveller type
- Compare pre- and post-COVID customer sentiment
- Propose a customer service chatbot design** for exceptional circumstances
